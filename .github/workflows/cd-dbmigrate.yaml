# TODO: prepare strategy for handling migration failures:
# - Backup: Always backup your database before running migrations.
# - Rollback: If a migration fails, you should rollback the migration and restore the backup. Always test your migrations in a staging environment before running them in production.
# - Monitoring: Monitor your application and database performance after running migrations.
