## How to start Devcontainer

1. install [Extension: Remote Development
   ](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) on your VSCode
2. Start [Docker desktop](https://www.docker.com/ja-jp/products/docker-desktop/) on your local machine or install it if you don't have it (sorry).
3. click skyblue button at the bottom left editor and select "Reopen in container"
   > this project's devcontainer spins up soon. Everything you need is already setup, so no additional configuration is required. wow.
4. start dev environment from inside the devcontainer running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Happy coding :)
