    # Volumes are the mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. these line here creats a bind mount, a type of volume that maps a host file or directory to a container file or directory.
    # When using bind mount with docker-outside-of-docker approach, the directory to mount must be specified by host path. This is because the Docker daemon inside the container does not have access to the host's filesystem. This environment variable allows you to refer to the Workspace host path.
    volumes:
      # this allows for real-time synchronization of changes between your local machine and the Docker container. Any changes you make to files in your local directory will be immediately reflected in the Docker container, and vice versa.

      # By mapping node_modules and prisma as a volume, the Docker container can access and use these dependencies just as if they were installed within the container itself. This can save significant time and resources because you don't need to reinstall your project's dependencies every time you build your Docker container.
